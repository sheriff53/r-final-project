Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease that develops when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. __It is the leading cause of death in the United States__.\n\n(Emphasis by me. Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/espanol/enfermedad-coronaria)\n\nAlso, according to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the __leading cause of death globally__ (source:  https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)). \n\nIn this notebook we try to learn enough information of this topic to understand the [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset and build simple models to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on features like the heart rate during exercise or the cholesterol levels in the blood.\n\n\n<a id=\"Context\"></a>\n# Context\n\n<a id=\"Blood-and-heart\"></a>\n## Blood and heart\n\nBlood is very important to ensure the proper functioning of the body. Its functions cover the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body as well as the removal of the cellular waste products.\n\nBlood is transported to the rest of the body because it is pumped by the heart. This organ receives oxygen-poor blood and sends it to the lungs to oxygenate it. And sends the oxygen-rich blood that comes from the lugns to the rest of the body.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosdg/PrediccionEnfermedadCoronaria/master/docs/images/Latidos.gif\" alt=\"Blood flow through the chambers of the heart\" />\n</p>\n\nBy josiño - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=9396374. Flow of the blood through the chambers of the heart. Blue arrows represent oxygen-poor blood received from the rest of the body and sent to the lungs. Red arrows represent oxygen-rich blood coming from the lungs that is sent to the rest of the body.\n\nAn inadequate supply of the blood can yield the cells to not get enough energy to function properly, causing the death of the cells in the worst case.\n\n\n<a id=\"Coronary-heart-disease\"></a>\n## Coronary heart disease\n\nThe heart also needs oxygen and nutrients to function properly, these come through arteries known as coronary arteries. When we talk about a coronary disease, we often mean a difficulty of the blood flow in these arteries due to the accumulation of substances on their walls.\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"figure\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosdg/PrediccionEnfermedadCoronaria/master/docs/images/Heart_attack-NIH.gif\" alt=\"Death of heart cells due to an ischemia in the coronary arteries\">\n</p>\n\nBy NIH: National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute - http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=25287085. Death of heart cells due to an ischemia in the coronary arteries.\n\nIn the worst case, the impact of leaving the cells of the heart without nutrients and oxygen is a heart attack, in other words, the death of part of the heart cells. This, in turn, would have an impact on the rest of the body because the pumping of the heart would be affected.\n\n\n<a id=\"Glossary-of-terms\"></a>\n## Glossary of terms\n\n- **Atherosclerosis:** accumulation of substances on the walls of arteries which can hinder the blood flow. Moreover, the rupture of this plaque of substances can cause the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) that, in turn, can block even more the affected area or go to other parts of the body and block those parts (embolism). (Sources: [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol/atherosclerosis), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569))\n\n- **Ischemia:** blood flow reduction to a tissue. This implies a reduction of the supply of oxygen and nutrients, so cells won't get enough energy to function properly. (Sources: [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia))\n\n- **Angina:** chest pain due to a blood flow reduction in the coronary arteries. (Sources: [United Kingdom National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/), [(Spanish) Video sobre angina de Alberto Sanagustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UhItS50mRI))\n\n- **Stable angina:** angina caused by situations that requires oxygen (for example, exercise or stress) and it goes away on rest.\n\n- **Unstable angina:** angina that can happen even on rest.\n\n- **Typican & atypical angina:** typical angina usually means a chest disconfort. However, looks like some people can experience other symptoms like nausea or shortness of breath. In these cases people talk about atypical angina. (Sources: [Harrington Hospital](https://www.harringtonhospital.org/typical-and-atypical-angina-what-to-look-for/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina#Diagnosis)).\n\n- **Thrombus:** blood mass in solid state that hinders the blood flow in a blood vessel. (Source: [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001124.htm))\n\n- **Embolus:** thrombus that detatches and goes to other parts of the body. (Source: [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001124.htm))\n\n- **Acute myocardial infarction:** also known as _heart attack_, is the death of part of the heart tissue due to an ischemia. In other words, it is the death of part of the cells due to the lack of oxygen. (Sources: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-myocardial-infarction#causes), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction))\n\n- **Electrocardiogram:** graph record of the electric signals that causes heart beats. Each part of the record of a normal heart beat has a name, the most interesting ones for this project are the T wave and the ST segment because they can give some information about the presence of issues like an ischemia or infarction. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983), [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiograma), [(Spanish) Video sobre electrocardiograma de Alberto Sanagustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A67NDj3_RrU), [(Spanish) Serie de videos sobre el electrocardiograma normal de Alberto Sangaustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLe281LBBRU&list=PL3BE5DA0A5DF3BF75))\n\n- **Nuclear stress test:** a radioactive dye is injected into the patient to see the blood flow on rest and doing exercise. Moreover, during this test the activity of the heart is also measured with an electrocardiogram. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nuclear-stress-test/about/pac-20385231), [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/thallium-stress-test))\n\n- **Asymptomatic disease:** a disease that a patient has but they experience very few or no symptoms. (Sources: [(Spanish) definicion.de](https://definicion.de/asintomatico/), [MayoClinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/es-es/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic))\n\n- **Left ventricular hypertrophy:** thickening of the walls of the main heart chamber that pumps the blood to the rest of the body. This can cause the muscle to loose elasticity which, in turns, causes the heart to not work properly. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/left-ventricular-hypertrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20374314))\n\n\n<a id=\"Dataset\"></a>\n# Dataset\n\nThis dataset is hosted on Kaggle ([Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)), and it was from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). There are records of about 300 patients from Cleveland and the features are described in a following section.\n\n\n<a id=\"Dataset-problems\"></a>\n## Dataset problems\n\nThanks to the [post of _InitPic_ ](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/discussion/105877) we noted that this dataset is a bit different from the original one while the description is the same. \n\nPart of these differences is that there were a few null values in the original dataset that have taken some values here:\n\n> A few more things to consider:\n> \n> data #93, 159, 164, 165 and 252 have ca=4 which is incorrect. In the original Cleveland dataset they are NaNs (so they should be removed)\n> \n> data #49 and 282 have thal = 0, also incorrect. They are also NaNs in the original dataset.\n\nBecause these are just a few instances, I decided to drop them. \n\nThere are also some differences regarding the features of the dataset which are corrected below.\n\n\n<a id=\"Dataset-features\"></a>\n## Dataset features","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(rpart.plot)\n\n# Read the data\ndata <- read.csv('../input/heart-disease-uci/heart.csv')\n\n# Drop the null values\nmissing_ca_indeces <- which(data$ca %in% 4)\nmissing_thal_indeces <-which(data$thal %in% 0)\nmissing_values_indeces <- c(missing_ca_indeces, missing_thal_indeces)\ndata <- data[-missing_values_indeces, ]\n\n# Transform categorical variable to R factors\ndata$sex <- as.factor(data$sex)\ndata$cp <- as.factor(data$cp)\ndata$fbs <- as.factor(data$fbs)\ndata$restecg <- as.factor(data$restecg)\ndata$exang <- as.factor(data$exang)\ndata$slope <- as.factor(data$slope)\ndata$thal <- as.factor(data$thal)\ndata$target <- as.factor(data$target)\n\n# Give a better name to the factor values for the graphs\nlevels(data$sex) <- c(\"Female\", \"Male\")\nlevels(data$cp) <- c(\"Asymptomatic\", \"Atypical angina\", \"No angina\", \"Typical angina\")\nlevels(data$fbs) <- c(\"No\", \"Yes\")\nlevels(data$restecg) <- c(\"Hypertrophy\", \"Normal\", \"Abnormalities\")\nlevels(data$exang) <- c(\"No\", \"Yes\")\nlevels(data$slope) <- c(\"Descending\", \"Flat\", \"Ascending\")\nlevels(data$thal) <- c(\"Fixed defect\", \"Normal flow\", \"Reversible defect\")\nlevels(data$target) <- c(\"Yes\", \"No\")","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-22T22:30:22.581719Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-22T22:30:22.585731Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-22T22:30:22.646135Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"target\"></a>\n### target\n\nTarget variable: whether the patient has a heart disease or not\n\n- Value 0: yes\n- Value 1: no\n\nWe can see that the distribution is quite balanced.
